            'content': `With first-choice goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo away on international duty at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup, De Gea was called up to the senior team as cover for Roberto. He made his debut for the Atlético first-team at the age of 18 on 30 September 2009, coming on as a substitute after Roberto was injured after 27 minutes of Atlético's UEFA Champions League Group stage match away to Porto; De Gea conceded two late goals as Atlético lost 2–0.[15] Roberto's injury meant that De Gea was given his La Liga debut three days later, at home to Real Zaragoza; he gave away a penalty kick in the 19th minute, but immediately redeemed himself by saving Marko Babić's attempt in a 2–1 win.[15][16] He described starting at the Vicente Calderón Stadium as a "dream since childhood".[17] In January 2010, De Gea was touted as a possible replacement for Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who was set to retire in 2011.[18] Days later, however, he signed a new contract which would keep him with Atlético until 2013.[19]`

            'content': `De Gea started 2010–11 in impressive fashion, helping Atlético win the season's UEFA Super Cup. In the 90th minute of the 2–0 win against Internazionale, he saved a Diego Milito penalty kick.[23] In September, it was reported that Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had missed a League Cup match with Scunthorpe United to travel to Spain to watch De Gea in action against Valencia.[24][25] De Gea played down the rumours, saying, "The important thing is that I have a contract here and I'm an Atletico player until 2013."[`
